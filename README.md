## Prerequisites

Before running the Music Player application, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- **Python**: The application is written in Python, so you need to have Python installed. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to install Python 3.x.

- **Tkinter**: Tkinter is Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit. It is usually included with Python installations, so you don't need to install it separately for most operating systems.

- **cx_Oracle**: If you're planning to use the database functionality(In my case i used Oracle Database 11g Express Edition), you'll need to install the `cx_Oracle` library. You can install it via pip:
